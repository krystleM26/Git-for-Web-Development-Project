Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Inline element doesn't start on a new line it only takes up the necessary width.
        While block element starts on a new line and ALWAYS takes up the full width available;
        it also has a top and bottom margin. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        The element will be taken out of flow, meaning it will align with its ancestor/parent element 
        that is not static.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        You will use a div and the CSS box model which consists of margin, padding, and borders.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
         3 elements that are display:block by default are the following:
                1. <p>
                2. <div>
                3  <ul>
        2 elements that are display: inline by default are the following:
                1. <img>
                2. <a>
        1 element that is display:inline-block by default is the following:
                1. button
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model consists of four areas known as the following:
                margin | border | padding | content
        "Fix" for the box model is am element positioned for the relative viewport; meaning 
        which keeps a box or section in the same place when a user scrolls a page
